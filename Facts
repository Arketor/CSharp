1. ref vs out : ref is normal return by reference like in C++, but if we use out then in the called function it should be 
   initialized else it will be a Compilation Error.


eg : 

class Solution
{
    public static void fun(out int x)
    {
        x=11; // If we remove this line it will give compilation error, because as per the rule the variable should be initialized in the called function. 
              // Also one thing to note is that is the variable (x here) should be initialized first before using it. So if we try to print x before initializing it, it will be a compilation error.
        Console.WriteLine("fun x = "+x);
        x=x*3;
        Console.WriteLine("fun x = "+x);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        int a=3;
        fun(out a);
        Console.WriteLine(a);
    }
}

2. Objects of a class are always passed by reference whereas integers and floats are passed by value
